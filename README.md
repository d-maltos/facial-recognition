# Facial Recognition Program
## About
### Authors
* Dylan Maltos
* Trevor Christian

### Summary 
A robust facial recognition application designed to identify and verify individuals through a graphical user interface. The application captures images, trains a model to recognize faces, and verifies registered users via a live webcam feed.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Before running the program, you must have Python installed on your machine. Python 3.6 or later is recommended.

### Requirements 
To install all the program requirements, execute the following command.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This command will install Python libraries such as OpenCV, which is essential for the image processing tasks involved in this project.

### Instructions
Once all the program requirements have been installed, you can run the program by executing the following command.
```
python app.py
```
This command launches the main application window, where you can register new users, capture datasets for training, and perform facial recognition through the integrated webcam interface.

## Technologies Used
* Python: A versatile programming language ideal for rapid application development and scripting in many contexts including data science and machine learning.
* OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library): A highly optimized library focused on real-time applications. Used in this project for its robust tools in handling image processing and facial recognition tasks.
* Tkinter: A python GUI (Graphic User Interface) library, used for building the interactive components of the application.
